<h1>About Me</h1>
<body>
    <p>
        Throughout my lifetime I have been lucky enough to see the development of computers, technology, and the internet into what it is today. The development that
        I have noticed the most is video games as it has been a hobby of mine my whole life. When I was child I would love to play on my gameboy, looking at a screen that did not illuminate in the dark,
        the graphics more closely resembling the static of a tv than real life. Now, video games look better than real life. This fact was a big factor in my decision to 
        get into this field. Being able to watch what I love grow and develop- and being apart of it's development, is a goal of mine. I have now realized that there are so 
        many options that video game development may never be something I put on my resume but I have found joy in other areas of computer programming too. Web page development allows me to 
        be creative and incorporate my own style into my work. Programming offers a challenge aswell as a way to enhance my problem solving capability's. I am excited to see where my education will take me,
        aswell as expanding my knowledge and understanding of computers and how they work.
