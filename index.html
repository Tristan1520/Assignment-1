        I am currently enrolled in Georgian College's computer programming course, in my first year. I am eager to learn everything I can to further 
        my knowledge in an ever growing and rapidly changing field. When deciding on a general field of knowledge to pursue there were lots of things to consider.
        For me, I knew that I had to do something that would peak my interest and give me a challenge, while remaining relevent during my lifetime. Computers are 
        a part of every day life in the year 2022, and that will not be changing anytime soon.

        Growing up with three siblings has been an invaluable part of making me into the person that I am today. From a young age having siblings taught me how to
        work with others to achieve a common goal, how to communicate effectively and ensure that all thoughts/ideas that are benefical are evaluated and used, and it has taught me when you are uncertain about something 
        it is imperative to seek clarification in order to complete a task with efficiency.
